    <h1>A Wasted Opportunity</h1>
    <p>I passed by the field of a sluggard,
      by the vineyard of a man lacking sense,
   and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns;
      the ground was covered with nettles,
      and its stone wall was broken down.
   Then I saw and considered it;
      I looked and received instruction.
   A little sleep, a little slumber,
      a little folding of the hands to rest,
   and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
      and want like an armed man.</p>
      <p>Proverbs 24:30-34 ESV</p>

  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.
